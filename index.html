                <p>Latest update: 4/24/18 -- Bear Creek is fishing well. Dry-Dropper rigs will be the most productive way to fish Bear Creek, with the majority of the eats on the nymphs; however, using a Dry as your indicator makes it easier to get a good drift in the low water, without spooking the fish with the presence of a generally harder-landing indicator.</p>

                <p>Latest update: 4/24/18 -- Clear Creek is runninng 75 cfs through Golden and is open throughout the majority of the canyon. Look for the lower canyon to produce the best results on the warmer days. Bring your box stocked with a good mix of smaller Stoneflies, Baetis, and Midges (think: Copper John, PTs, Prince Nymph, Hares Ear, Zebra Midge, RS2 variations, Two Bit Hooker, and it doesn't hurt to have some San Juan Worms and Cannon's Worms).</p>

                <p>Latest update: 4/24/2018 -- Flows are 122 cfs. Stay true to the general tailwater fly selection consisting of Worms (Wire worms, San Juans, Span flex), Eggs, Baetis, and Midge patterns in the #16-#22 range. Dillon Reservoir is full of Mysis shrimp, and as these are sucked through the dam and flushed out the other side the trout gorge on them.</p>
